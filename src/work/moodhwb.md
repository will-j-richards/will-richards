  Overview
</h2>
<p class="article-content">
        As a founder of Moon, a design and technology studio, I was invited by Dr. Rhys Bevan-Jones, a senior research fellow at Cardiff University, to tender for the development of a web programme aimed at supporting young people with their mood and wellbeing.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
        The first phase was to evaluate the feasibility of a digital intervention programme which later became titled MoodHwb. 
</p>
<p class="article-content">
        The development was initiated through a series of interviews and focus groups conducted with potential users. Specifically, young individuals who were experiencing symptoms of low mood or were considered to be at risk, as well as parents or carers, and professionals who specialise in the field. 
</p>

  Young people-centred collaboration
</h2>
<p class="article-content">
        Upon the initial research findings, a series of workshops were conducted to analyse and identify the key user needs. Through collaborative discussions and activities, we were able to prioritise these needs and establish a clear direction for the development of a prototype.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
        The initial prototype design consisted of two distinct sections. The first was a psychoeducation package that provided users with valuable health information and recommendations for self-management. The second part of the prototype was a series of interactive tools that enabled users to track and monitor their moods. Based on their inputs, the tools provided personalised recommendations for a range of possible interventions.

        In collaboration with Carbon Studio, we incorporated illustrations and videos into the design to make it informative and appealing.

        Evaluation and feasibility study
</h2>
<p class="article-content">
        A number of young people and their carers were recruited to participate in an evaluation study of the prototype. The participants provided valuable feedback, indicating that the prototype was engaging, clear, and user-friendly. Specifically, the young people found the mood monitoring and self-help features to be particularly helpful. 
</p>
<p class="article-content">
        Building upon the feedback and insights gathered during the first evaluation, a second prototype has been developed with refinements to the interactive aspects of the programme. Additionally, we have designed and developed apps for both iOS and Android platforms.
</p>
<p class="article-content">
        The second evaluation is ongoing.
