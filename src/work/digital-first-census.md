  Overview
</h2>

<p class="article-content">
  The Office for National Statistics embarked on an initiative to digitally transform the census, replacing the traditional paper-based approach that involved posting questionnaires to millions of households.
</p>

<p class="article-content">
  The primary objective was to attain a high completion rate of 90% from approximately 27 million households. It was crucial that the survey be inclusive and accessible to the entire population. The design of the survey had to ensure that every single household was accurately accounted for, as incomplete or inaccurate data could have significant impacts on many aspects of society.

  A questionnaire to used by everyone
</h2>

<p class="article-content">
  I was contracted to lead the design for the end-to-end journey for the electronic questionnaire. There were many design challenges to address including patterns for counting occupants and establishing their relationships within a household, to collecting personal data about each occupant and developing a service where occupants within the same household could submit their responses privately.

<p class="article-content">
  One major challenge the team encountered was determining who to recruit for user research. To address this, I devised a matrix that cross-referenced potential pain points in the service with previously identified personas. This approach proved invaluable in helping our team develop a robust research plan and effectively recruit relevant participants.

  Test and test again
</h2>

<p class="article-content">
  Within the design and development process, we adopted a progressive enhancement model and a mobile-first approach. We collaborated with the Digital Accessibility Centre to conduct accessibility testing of the question patterns. While the employees at the centre are proficient in using assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice-activated software, we recognised the importance of inclusivity and accessibility for all users. To ensure that our service and question patterns met these standards, we conducted prototype testing with participants in their own homes. You can read more about this approach in a blog post <a href="https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2019/04/09/making-online-questionnaires-inclusive-and-accessible/" aria-label="Making Online Questionnaires Inclusive and Accessible Blog Post">Making online questionnaires inclusive and accessible</a> by Charlotte Hirst. 
</p>

<p class="article-content">
  After completing the iterative design and research cycles, the prototypes were then published in the ONS Design System, which we originally developed to document survey design.

  A digital-first census
</h2>
<p class="article-content">
  The Census was hailed as the first truly digital-first census with 89% of all households receiving an invitation by post to complete the census online. 11% of households were sent paper questionnaires however 46.4% of those completed it online.
