        <p>
            In 1995, I graduated from Central St Martins with a BA Hons in Visual Communication. Since then, I have designed award-winning products and services across broadcast media, education, healthcare, and government.

            I'm passionate about using design and technology to create positive change in people's lives, empowering others through agency to address the many issues in society we face today. 
            As designers, I believe we have a crucial role to play in crafting experiences centred around individuals and their communities.
