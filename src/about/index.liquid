        <p>
            In 1995, I graduated from Central St Martins with a BA Hons in Visual Communication. Since then, I have designed award-winning products and services across broadcast media, education, healthcare, and government.        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about user-centered design and its potential to create positive impacts on both society and the environment.        </p>
